You're first responsible for planning, and then, based on that plan, generating the teaching webpage. I want to create an educational webpage that teaches a specific chemistry problem. You are the instructional web designer (planner), in charge of the overall structural layout, interaction design, visual guidance, and pedagogical flow.


This webpage should not only help students solve a specific problem:

<problem>


It must also gradually build students’ skills in scientific modeling, abstract reasoning, and analogical transfer. You should specifically design both near-transfer and far-transfer problems to assess and reinforce the transfer of conceptual understanding across different chemistry contexts.
The instruction should be student-centered, progressive, and guided, encouraging hands-on interaction and conceptual visualization.
Make sure to include:
•	Real-world or lab-based scenarios that contextualize the problem meaningfully.
•	Interactive visual aids (molecular models, reaction diagrams, simulations).
•	Use of the Concrete–Representational–Abstract (CRA) approach to help students move from observable phenomena to symbolic reasoning.
•	Step-by-step scaffolding strategies (e.g., F.O.P.S – Find, Organize, Plan, Solve) for building scientific reasoning and solving the problem.
•	Opportunities for students to practice metacognitive strategies (e.g., “What do I know?”, “What principles apply?”, “How do I check my answer?”).
Your goal is to make the webpage instructionally rich, visually engaging, and transfer-focused, helping learners master both the core problem and the deeper conceptual structures that support scientific thinking.
Instructional Structure Plan (for Chemistry Content Delivery)
________________________________________
1. Helping Students Understand the Context:
•	Use realistic or semi-realistic chemistry scenarios (e.g., a lab experiment, a medical application, an industrial process) to provide immersion and relevance.
•	Incorporate simple illustrations, molecular diagrams, lab equipment visuals, comic-style characters (like a student scientist or a lab assistant), or infographics to visually guide students into the problem’s real-world context.
•	Teachers should explicitly point out the connection between physical substances and abstract concepts, such as relating bubbling gas to reaction rates, or connecting solution color to chemical equilibrium.
________________________________________
2. Expressing the Information Accurately:
•	Teach students to organize chemical information using visual and symbolic tools, such as:
o	Molecular structure diagrams
o	Reaction pathway flowcharts
o	Lab procedure schematics
o	Particle-level illustrations
o	Tables for molar ratios, pH values, concentrations, etc.
•	Apply the Concrete–Representational–Abstract (CRA) model:
o	Concrete: Demonstrate with observable phenomena (e.g., color change, gas release, precipitate formation).
o	Representational: Use particle diagrams, chemical equations, or models.
o	Abstract: Transition to symbolic representations (balanced equations, formulas, stoichiometric calculations).
•	Encourage students to verbalize their chemical reasoning using “Think Aloud” strategies—for example, explaining what happens at the particle level when an acid is added to a base.
________________________________________
3. Guiding Students to Build Scientific Models:
•	Break down complex chemical problems (e.g., multi-step stoichiometry, limiting reactants, Le Chatelier’s Principle) into smaller, scaffolded steps:
o	Identify what's happening (physical change? redox? equilibrium shift?)
o	Use diagrams or equations to represent the system
o	Plan stepwise reasoning (e.g., molar ratio → calculate moles → convert to mass)
•	Introduce the chemistry-adapted F.O.P.S strategy:
o	F – Find the core chemical principle (e.g., conservation of mass, acid-base neutralization)
o	O – Organize known and unknown quantities using tables, equations, or visual models
o	P – Plan your approach (which law or formula applies? what conversions are needed?)
o	S – Solve the problem, explaining and checking each step
🔁 Transfer Tasks for Developing Core Competencies (Chemistry Version)
To help students strengthen their analogical reasoning and abstract transfer skills, provide two types of follow-up problems after the main chemistry problem is taught:
________________________________________
📌 Near-Transfer Problem (Same structure, different content)
•	Create a problem that retains the same underlying chemical structure or reasoning pattern, but changes the context, substances, or numerical values slightly.
•	Example:
“A reaction produces 12.0 g of a compound when 3.0 g of reactant A is used, and the mass ratio between product and reactant is 4:1. How much product will form from 7.5 g of A?”
•	This type of problem mirrors the same stoichiometric or proportional logic as the main problem, but offers a different surface situation.
•	Students must recognize and apply the same modeling strategy in a new but structurally similar context.
________________________________________
📌 Far-Transfer Problem (Different surface features, same underlying structure)
•	Design a problem that looks and feels completely different from the original, but shares the same core modeling structure or quantitative reasoning framework.
•	Example:
“A gas occupies 10.0 L at 2.0 atm. What was its original volume if it was compressed to 4.0 atm, assuming temperature and amount of gas remain constant?”
•	While the content shifts from reaction stoichiometry to gas laws, the student must still apply an inverse relationship model (Boyle’s Law: P₁V₁ = P₂V₂), structurally similar to mass ratios or proportional models in chemical reactions.
•	This tests whether students can abstract the underlying principles and apply them in novel chemical scenarios.
Learning Approach & Cognitive Support Strategies (Chemistry Version)
________________________________________
🔧 Scaffolded Practice:
•	Begin with teacher-guided, joint problem-solving using real chemical scenarios (e.g., stoichiometry, equilibrium, titration).
•	Gradually shift responsibility to the student by providing interactive scaffolded tasks, such as:
o	Partially completed chemical equations or reaction tables
o	Selecting the correct next step in a procedure (e.g., “What’s the limiting reactant?”)
o	Evaluating the relevance of given experimental data or lab conditions
________________________________________
🧠 Metacognitive Strategies for Chemistry Learners:
•	Encourage students to develop self-instruction and self-monitoring habits, especially when analyzing experimental setups, applying formulas, or checking units and results.
Example self-instruction prompts:
•	“Do I understand what this reaction or system is about?”
•	“What is the goal of this question—mass? volume? concentration?”
•	“Which chemical principle applies here—conservation of mass, equilibrium, redox?”
Self-monitoring tools:
•	Reaction-solving checklists (e.g., “Is the equation balanced?” “Have I used correct mole ratios?”)
•	Common error spot-checks (e.g., unit conversions, wrong molar masses)
•	Final answer plausibility checks (e.g., “Does the pH value make sense?” “Is the yield realistic?”)
________________________________________
🗣 Teacher Modeling via Think Aloud:
•	Teachers should model these cognitive strategies explicitly during instruction:
o	Verbally walk through analyzing a reaction setup
o	Pause to ask themselves clarifying questions
o	Demonstrate how to check for consistency and reasonableness in a final answer
